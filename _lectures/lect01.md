# Software you need: Windows Version

* Latest version of Python 3 for Windows from <https://python.org>
* Git for Windows: <https://git-scm.com/download/win>

Troubleshooting:
* When installing Python, be sure to customize, and click the option about environment variables
* If python hangs in the git bash shell, use: `alias python='winpty python.exe'`

# Software you need: Mac Version


* Latest version of Python 3 for Mac <https://python.org>
* Git is likely already included with Mac OS, so you probably don't need to download that.


# Software you need: Linux Version

* X11 is probably already installed
* Upgrade your Python to 3.6.5 if it is a later version. If you running Linux, you probably know how to do that.
* Git is probably already installed.


# Accounts that you need

* Create a github.com account on the free plan if you don't already have one, here: <http://github.com>
   * If you haven't already done it, add your `___@umail.ucsb.edu` address (specifically your `@umail.ucsb.edu` address, not `@ucsb.edu`) to your github.com account, and then "verify" that email address.
   * Visit <https://ucsb-cs-github-linker.herokuapp.com/>, log in with your github.com account, and join the class CCS-CS20-W20.

# The syllabus

The syllabus is Coming soon (by Thursday)

# Abstractions and Algorithms

(a review of part of the syllabus)

Abstractions and notation: three, index.

An index takes in as input a topic, and gives us back a page number.

A Point-of-Sale bar code scanner at a store checkout maps a barcode, to info about the item (description and price).

A FUNCTION in general, takes in an input (or a set of inputs) and gives us back a value.

In math, for example, 

f(x) = x<sup>2</sup>
